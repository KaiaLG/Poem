Once upon a time, in a world far, far away...
there was a girl named Kaia and a boy named Taj
and they decided to devise a plan to murder all their friends -cough cough alec cough cough- for being too annoying
And while they were planning, they realized subconciously that they were perfect for each other and began to fall in love!

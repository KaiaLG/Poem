Once upon a time, in a world far, far away...
there was a girl named Kaia and a boy named Taj
and they decided to devise a plan to murder all their friends -cough cough alec cough cough- for being too annoying
And while they were planning, they realized subconciously that they were perfect for each other and began to fall in love!
and they fell laughing to the floor at the hideous thought. However, they then decided to inflict pain upon their criends-alec- and and summoned glowing rubber duckies to destroy his life
But the rubber duckies were old and wise, and decided to share thier sage knowledge with the lovers in denial, and yet the lovers didn't listen, and continued to yell at the ducks to attackthier criends, which left the ducks confused because they were not aware of what a criend is.
but as the duckies left, they then turned back to the annoying friend and said shamaunu. Then the three fates came and told the annoying friend and the sage duckies that they could see all and convene with aphrodite and that the two friends were just that-friends. Then the fates decided to kill the annoying friend in retribution. They murdered him by letting him drown in a bathtub, before placing him in the Fields of Punishment for all of eternity
